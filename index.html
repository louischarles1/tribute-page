    <p>Chadwick Aaron Boseman (November 29, 1976 – August 28, 2020) was an African-American actor, playwright and film producer. He was well known for portraying historical figures such as Jackie Robinson in the 2013 biographical sports drama 42, James Brown in the 2014 biographical musical drama Get on Up, and Thurgood Marshall in the 2017 biographical legal drama Marshall (2017).</p>
    <p>For Disney, he played T'Challa/Black Panther in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War, and Avengers: Endgame. His role as the voice of T'Challa in the first season of What If...? was his final role.</p>
    <p>On August 28, 2020, Boseman passed away following a 4-year battle with colon cancer. He was due to reprise his role as Black Panther in the sequel, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, before he died. He passed away before production had began. On November 15, 2020, executive producer Victoria Alonso denied rumors that a digital body double of Boseman would be used for Wakanda Forever, saying "our king has died in real life, not only in fiction, and we’re taking a little time to see how we continue the story..."[1]</p>
